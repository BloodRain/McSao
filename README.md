Hey Chris, make this ReadMe fancy will yah, this thing needs a list of example TODOS i will change them when you lay they out for the Developers
a TODO list for the Texture Artists
the current goal at hand
and lastly the overall percentage of the current goal

just lay it out all abstractly and in examples. I will come back after its done to replace the example template with current stuff :) please thankyou

*EDIT* @Chris I'll be contributing to this README and I'll be working on management, just gonna need you to help me with seting up dev todos so we can work together to make this purdy. - Blood
